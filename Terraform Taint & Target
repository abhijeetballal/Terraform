Terraform Taint and Target

In terraform Target, if you have 2 or 3 instances running and you have to delete only 1 out of 3. for ex.
aws_instance.instance-1
aws_instance.instance-2
And you have to delete only 2 instance then use below comment to delete on 2 instance:
$terraform destroy -target aws_instance.instance-2 --auto-approve

In terraform Taint, if you tainted the ec2 instance using below command and you did some changes in its code.
$terraform taint aws_instance.instance-1
It will destroy that ec2 instance and create it again from begining or from starting.
Tainted resource is consider as a corrupt resource.
