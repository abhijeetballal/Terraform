LOCAL VARIABLE

In local variable you can 2 conditions.
One is for "cidr range" and second is for "name". Just add the locals block to main.tf file, mentioned as below:
locals {
  vpc_name = "${terraform.workspace == "dev" ? "demo-vpc-dev" : "demo-vpc-prod"}"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  count            = "${terraform.workspace == "dev" ? 0 : 1}"
  cidr_block       = "${var.cidr_range}"
  instance_tenancy = "default"

  tags = {
    Name = "${local.vpc_name}"
    Environment = "${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket-0409"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-demo-table"
  }
}
