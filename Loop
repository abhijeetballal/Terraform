LOOP - COUNT VARIABLE OR CONDITIONAL LOOP

We can add as much as count we want of VPC or EC2 etc. Only by adding the count in code after the resource line
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  count            = 5
  cidr_block       = "${var.cidr_range}"
  instance_tenancy = "default"

  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-vpc"
    Environment = "${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket-0409"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-demo-table"
  }
}

Or we can apply the condition also in count section mention as below
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  count            = "${terraform.workspace == "dev" ? 0 : 1}"
  cidr_block       = "${var.cidr_range}"
  instance_tenancy = "default"

  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-vpc"
    Environment = "${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket-0409"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-demo-table"
  }
}
